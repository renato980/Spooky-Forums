And that’s just the Last Resort. Enter the ScareScraper for 8-player local wireless or online co-op gameplay.<br><br>See if you can defeat all the ghosts, rescue all the toads, or clear other objectives before time runs out…in the ScareScraper! And for more mini-game madness, compete on teams at the ScreamPark! Whether you play with friends or wander the hotel alone, you’ll be sucked in by the atmospheric music and ghoulish décor of every cobwebby corner you explore. Why not take in the cinematic sights and sounds with a friend? In the main adventure, you and a friend can play together as Luigi and Gooigi in two-player co-op! Gooigi can walk on spikes, slip through tight spaces, and help Luigi overcome obstacles he can’t tackle alone. Never hurts to have a friend in this hotel; it may not be very spooky, but Luigi begs to differ!</p></div></section><div class="messageboard"><h2>Reviews</h2><div class="review_block"><h3>Review 1</h3><p>I absolutely love this series and I'm glad they decided to realease another entry.

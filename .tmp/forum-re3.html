						<p>The third entry in the Resident Evil series. The T-virus has spread
						all over Racoon City and Jill Valentine is caught in the middle of it.
						However, the true threat isn't the zombies and monsters. Something seems
						to be after her and won't let her escape the city so easily.</p>

						<p>This game was so amazing for it's time. I'm glad they brought back Jill from the first game and
						nemesis is such a great enemy design that makes this game so much fun and so scary to play.</p>

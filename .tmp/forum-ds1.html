						<p>The USG Ishimura sends out a distress signal and the Kellion is sent to investigate.
						When their ship malfunctions and crashes into the Ishimura they encounter horrific monstrtosities.
						Take control of engineer Isaac Clarke and survive against these grotesque monsters and escape
						the Ishimura.</p><br>
						<h4>Messy monster slaying</h4>
						<p>The Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do
						about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their
						insect-like limbs, one at a time.</p><br>
						<h4>Improvised weapons</h4>
						<p>There aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power
						in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter,
						remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of
						destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to
						increase ammo, power, and reload speed.</p><br>
						<h4>Real-time attacks</h4>
						<p>Whatever you do, don’t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action
						you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect
						opportunity to attack. This nightmare has just begun and it’s up to get to the bottom of what happened
						here.</p>

						<p>This is such an amazing game, the graphics are great, the combat is amazing, and it is extremely scary as well. You never know when

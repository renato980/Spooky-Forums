						<h2>A Monster of a Sequel</h2>

						<p>The second entry in the Dead Space series. Three years after Dead Space,
						Isaac Clarke awakens in a space station called the "Sprawl." There is a new necropmorph
						oubreak aboard the Sprawl and it is up to Isaac to stop it and uncover the truth of
						the outbreak and the dimentia he is now experiencing.</p><br>
						<h4>Enter the Sprawl</h4>
						<p>The threat facing Isaac is no longer confined to a singular space station. You'll face Necromorphs
						in Zero G environments. Strap on your suit boosters, blast through the Church of Unitology, and jet
						across the Solar Array.</p><br>
						<h4>Fight a deadlier enemy</h4>
						<p>New Necromorph breeds await, including the stealthy Stalker strain and creepy, infested children
						known as The Pack. Use your unconventional arsenal of traditional firearms, like the mine-shooting
						Detonator, and weaponized engineering tools, like the rapid-fire Rivet Gun, and you just might make
						it out alive.</p><br>
						<h4>Are you crazy?</h4>
						<p>Delve into the mysteries surrounding the Necromorph infestation and learn more about Isaac
						Clarke's tortured past. You may even catch a glimpse of the elusive engineer's face as he interacts
						with the precious few survivors aboard The Sprawl.</p>

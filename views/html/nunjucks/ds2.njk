						<h2>A Monster of a Sequel</h2>
						<p>In Dead Space 2, you join Isaac Clarke, the Systems Engineer from Dead Space, as he wakes up three
						years after the horrific events on the USG Ishimura. The Ishimura was a Planetcracker-class starship
						besieged by grotesque reanimations of its dead crew, known as Necromorphs.<br>
            <br>After unearthing a strange artifact known as the Marker, Isaac finds himself on the Sprawl, a giant
            space station in orbit around Saturn. Unable to remember how he got here and plagued with demented
            visions of his dead girlfriend Nicole, he must survive another nightmarish outbreak of Necromorphs
            as he fights his way towards an answer he hopes will end all the chaos.</p><br>
						<h4>Enter the Sprawl</h4>
						<p>The threat facing Isaac is no longer confined to a singular space station. You'll face Necromorphs
						in Zero G environments. Strap on your suit boosters, blast through the Church of Unitology, and jet
						across the Solar Array.</p><br>
						<h4>Fight a deadlier enemy</h4>
						<p>New Necromorph breeds await, including the stealthy Stalker strain and creepy, infested children
						known as The Pack. Use your unconventional arsenal of traditional firearms, like the mine-shooting
						Detonator, and weaponized engineering tools, like the rapid-fire Rivet Gun, and you just might make
						it out alive.</p><br>
						<h4>Are you crazy?</h4>
						<p>Delve into the mysteries surrounding the Necromorph infestation and learn more about Isaac
						Clarke's tortured past. You may even catch a glimpse of the elusive engineer's face as he interacts
						with the precious few survivors aboard The Sprawl.</p>

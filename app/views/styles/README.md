# Sass Boilerplate
This is a variant of the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Be sure to browse the repository to see how it works.

## The Main file
The main file (usually labeled `main.scss`) should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.

					 			<h2>About the Game:</h2>
			 					<p>Review Score: 5/5</p>
			 					<p>The third entry in the Resident Evil series. The T-virus has spread
					 			all over Racoon City and Jill Valentine is caught in the middle of it.
					 			However, the true threat isn't the zombies and monsters. Something seems
					 			to be after her and won't let her escape the city so easily.</p>

                <h3>Review 1</h3>
								<p>This game was such a classic for it's time. I'm glad they brought back Jill from the first game and
								nemesis is such a great enemy design that makes this game so much fun and so scary to play.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="review">
								<h3>Review 2</h3>
								<p>Rebuilt from the ground up, Capcom's survival horror classic returns better and
								bloodier than ever. Featuring a stunning visual presentation, updated controls and
								immersive audio design, Resident Evil 2 brings the zombie-infested Raccoon City Police
								Department to life (and death) like never before. Offering a bone-chilling blend of
								cryptic puzzles, resource conservation and encounters with infected freaks, this one
								is best enjoyed with the lights down and the volume up.</p>

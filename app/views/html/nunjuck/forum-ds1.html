							<p>Review Score: 5/5</p>

								<h3>Review 1</h3>
								<p>This is such an amazing game, the graphics are great, the combat is amazing, and it is extremely scary as well. You never know when
								one of the monsters will appear as you explore the ship.</p>

								<h3>Review 2</h3>
								<p>Rebuilt from the ground up, Capcom's survival horror classic returns better and
								bloodier than ever. Featuring a stunning visual presentation, updated controls and
								immersive audio design, Resident Evil 2 brings the zombie-infested Raccoon City Police
								Department to life (and death) like never before. Offering a bone-chilling blend of
								cryptic puzzles, resource conservation and encounters with infected freaks, this one
								is best enjoyed with the lights down and the volume up.</p>

								<p>Slam, blow away, and vacuum up ghosts with the all-new Poltergust G-00, and join
								forces with Gooigi to overcome the puzzling contraptions and mischievous boss on each
								themed floor. And that’s just the Last Resort. Enter the ScareScraper for 8-player
								local wireless or online co-op gameplay.<br>

								<br>See if you can defeat all the ghosts, rescue all the toads, or clear other objectives
								before time runs out…in the ScareScraper! And for more mini-game madness, compete on
								teams at the ScreamPark! Whether you play with friends or wander the hotel alone,
								you’ll be sucked in by the atmospheric music and ghoulish décor of every cobwebby
								corner you explore. Why not take in the cinematic sights and sounds with a friend?
								In the main adventure, you and a friend can play together as Luigi and Gooigi in
								two-player co-op! Gooigi can walk on spikes, slip through tight spaces, and help
								Luigi overcome obstacles he can’t tackle alone. Never hurts to have a friend in this
								hotel; it may not be very spooky, but Luigi begs to differ!</p>

                <h3>Review 1</h3>
								<p>Rebuilt from the ground up, Capcom's survival horror classic returns better and
								bloodier than ever. Featuring a stunning visual presentation, updated controls and
								immersive audio design, Resident Evil 2 brings the zombie-infested Raccoon City Police
								Department to life (and death) like never before. Offering a bone-chilling blend of
								cryptic puzzles, resource conservation and encounters with infected freaks, this one
								is best enjoyed with the lights down and the volume up.</p>

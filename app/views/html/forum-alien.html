                <h3>Review 1</h3>
								<p>Rebuilt from the ground up, Capcom's survival horror classic returns better and
								bloodier than ever. Featuring a stunning visual presentation, updated controls and
								immersive audio design, Resident Evil 2 brings the zombie-infested Raccoon City Police
								Department to life (and death) like never before. Offering a bone-chilling blend of
								cryptic puzzles, resource conservation and encounters with infected freaks, this one
								is best enjoyed with the lights down and the volume up.</p>

						<h3>Review 1</h3>
						<p>Hollow Knight is exceptional because its smaller, expertly designed
								parts fit so well together over an extraordinarily long adventure. Its expansive enemy
								roster and routinely surprising areas and platforming challenges ensure that your
								journey through this fallen bug kingdom is one you're unlikely to forget. Hollow
								Knight offers a surprisingly large and haunting adventure.</p>

						<h3>Review 2</h3>
						<p>Hollow Knight is an amazing metroidvania game in every way. The art and music
								are absolutely beautiful and work great together. Its 2D world is rich and story is
								unexpectedly compelling!</p>

						<h3>Review 3</h3>
						<p>Hollow Knight is a beautiful Metroidvania that is absolutely rich
								in detail from its dynamic combat system to its charming art and sound
								design. This is one of the greatest adventures you can go on, I highly recommend
								playing it.</p>

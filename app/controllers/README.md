# Controllers as Nunjucks Files
**Only** Nunjucks files — using the `.njk` extension — may be placed in this folder. Much like the controllers found on hardware devices, such as SSDs or graphics cards, these files act as the liaison between your models (which contain data) and your views (which is the front-end set of web technologies).
